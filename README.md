# Create Freon

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/create-freon.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-freon)

**The easiest way to start a new Freon language project.**  
With a single command, Create Freon generates a complete project scaffold for your domain-specific language (DSL), including everything you need to build and run a browser-based editor.

💡 You can start from an **empty scaffold** or choose one of the example languages provided in [create-freon-languages](https://github.com/freon4dsl/create-freon-languages):

- 📘 **CourseSchedule** – a simple scheduling DSL
- ⚙️ **CustomizationsProject** – demonstrates customizing a generated project
- 🎓 **Education** – a DSL for modeling education structures
- 🧮 **EducationInterpreter** – adds an interpreter to the Education DSL
- 🔢 **Expressions** – a small arithmetic expression language
- 🛡️ **Insurance** – a DSL for modeling insurance products
- 🚀 **StarterLanguage** – a minimal language to get started quickly
- 🧩 **TyperExample** – demonstrates typing rules in practice

To create a new Freon language project, run:
